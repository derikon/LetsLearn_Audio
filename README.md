# Let's Learn Audio


## Software - Frameworks, Libraries, Applications


### ofxPDSP

> ofxPDSP is an openFrameworks addon for audio synthesis and generative music.
It includes a good selection of modules ready to be used, like antialiasied oscillators and VA filters, an FFT convolver, analog-sounding envelopes, a delay, a noise generator, a sampler and a graincloud module, biquad equalizers (normal and 2x oversampled), modules for dynamic processing, units for oversampling/downsampling and a framework for writing and sequencing generative music. On top of that some other classes that uses openFrameworks for adding midi and OSC in/out, serial output, sequencer monitoring, waveform plotting and scopes, other audio addon wrapping and ofParameter-compatible control.

### eDSP

> eDSP (easy Digital Signal Processing) is a digital signal processing framework written in modern C++ that implements some of the common functions and algorithms frequently used in digital signal processing, audio engineering & telecommunications systems.
It aims to provide efficient and streamlined base calculations while at the same time having a straightforward and easy-to-use interface similar to another numeric language like MATLAB. The library integrates a C++ and Python interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android.

### DSPFilters

> Building on the work of cherished luminaries such as Sophocles Orfanidis, Andreas Antoniou, Martin Holters, and Udo Zolzer, this library harnesses the power of C++ templates to solve a useful problem in Digital Signal Processing: the realization of multichannel IIR filters of arbitrary order and prescribed specifications with various properties such as Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, and Optimum-L (Legendre) responses.

### Faust

> What is Faust?
Faust (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. Faust targets high-performance signal processing applications and audio plug-ins for a variety of platforms and standards.
The core component of Faust is its compiler. It allows to "translate" any Faust digital signal processing (DSP) specification to a wide range of non-domain specific languages such as C++, C, JAVA, JavaScript, LLVM bit code, WebAssembly, etc. In this regard, Faust can be seen as an alternative to C++ but is much simpler and intuitive to learn.

## Hardware - DIY

### OTTO

> The OTTO is a complete hardware and software solution, with synths, a sampler, effects, sequencers, and studio modules. The interface is modal, easy to use, simple, but most of all, it encourages experimentation. The graphics are quirky, and the workflow is minimal.
